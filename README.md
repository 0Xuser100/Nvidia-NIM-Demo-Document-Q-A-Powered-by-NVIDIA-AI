# Nvidia NIM Demo: Document Q&A Powered by NVIDIA AI

## 🌟 Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of NVIDIA AI endpoints with LangChain to create an interactive document-based Q&A system. By embedding documents and leveraging NVIDIA's powerful language models, users can ask questions and receive context-aware answers in real-time.

## 🛠 Features
- **Streamlit Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI for seamless interaction.
- **Document Embedding:** Efficiently processes and stores documents in a vector database for retrieval.
- **AI-Powered Responses:** Uses NVIDIA language models like `meta/llama3-70b-instruct` to generate precise answers.
- **Custom Prompt Templates:** Tailors AI responses based on specific user queries.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- NVIDIA API Key (Add it to a `.env` file)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0Xuser100/Nvidia-NIM-Demo-Document-Q-A-Powered-by-NVIDIA-AI.git
   cd  Nvidia-NIM-Demo-Document-Q-A-Powered-by-NVIDIA-AI
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add your NVIDIA API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add the following line:
     ```env
     NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

### Usage
1. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Open the Streamlit link displayed in the terminal to interact with the Q&A system.

### Key Functionality
- **Document Embedding:**
  - Click the "Documents Embedding" button to process and store documents in a vector database.
- **Ask Questions:**
  - Enter your question in the input field to receive answers based on the embedded documents.
- **Document Similarity Search:**
  - View relevant document chunks in the "Document Similarity Search" section.

## 📂 File Structure
- `app.py` - Main application script for Streamlit.
- `requirements.txt` - List of required Python libraries.
- `us_census/` - Directory containing sample documents for embedding.

## 🤝 Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests to enhance its functionality. Contributions are welcome, whether it’s improving document embedding, optimizing AI integration, or adding new features.
